.NET MAUI is a powerful framework from Microsoft that allows developers to create native applications across multiple platforms—iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS—using a single shared codebase in C#. By using MAUI, you can build responsive, native applications that run seamlessly on different devices while maintaining a consistent user experience. MAUI simplifies cross-platform development by providing a unified interface for working with UI elements, graphics, and platform-specific features, allowing you to develop apps more efficiently.
